1) Create a synthetic dataset  for the credit default problem. You may choose priors suitably. Generate 10^4 points from you model. Using the generated dataset evaluate a) bayes classifier and b) classifier which has a randomization built in. 
2) On the Handwritten dataset attached, evaluate the bayes classifier with naive bayes assumption. You may rescale the pixel values to 0,1. As described in class, split the dataset randomly to 80:20 to training and test dataset. 
3) Extra credit (optional): Repeat 2 by implementing your own naive bayes classifier.
